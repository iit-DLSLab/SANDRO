# SANDRO: A Robust Solver with a Splitting Strategy for Point Cloud Registration  

## Overview  

SANDRO (Splitting strategy for point cloud Alignment using Non-convex anD Robust Optimization) is a novel algorithm for point cloud registration. It integrates an **Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS)** framework with a **Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC) approach** and a **Geman-McClure robust loss function** to handle high outlier rates and skewed outlier distributions.  

A key feature of SANDRO is its **splitting strategy**, which partitions the point cloud into smaller subsets to **reduce bias from symmetrical outliers** and improve convergence. This technique allows SANDRO to handle complex registration problems that often cause failures in traditional methods.  

Unlike traditional methods that struggle with **point cloud symmetries** and **high outlier rates**, SANDRO achieves superior accuracy and robustness.
